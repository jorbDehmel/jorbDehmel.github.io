## [ARBFN: Arbitrary Externally-Computed Closed-Loop Force Fixes in LAMMPS](https://github.com/jorbDehmel/lammps_ARBFN)

Spring 2025, paper in preparation for journal submission

**Jordan Dehmel (CMU)**, Jarrod Schiffbauer (CMU)

Abstract:

> The molecular dynamics simulation software LAMMPS
> (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator)
> provides a scripting language for the easy implementation of
> experiments: However, it is not all-encompassing. There are
> many situations in which LAMMPS alone is not sufficient and
> some external computation must be used, for example, including
> quantum effects [Kohlmeyer, Ippolito, Cavazzoni, 2014] and
> machine learning control [Rohskopf et. al., 2023] of a
> simulation. Such situations provide some custom interface for
> a specific program to apply forces on the simulated particles.
> This project outlines the development of a generic protocol
> for this process. Specifically, we introduce an
> externally-controlled arbitrary atomic forcing fix within the
> existing MPI (Message Passing Interface) LAMMPS framework
> [OpenMPI, 2003] [Thompson et. al., 2024]. This involves an
> arbitrary-language controller program being instantiated
> alongside LAMMPS in an MPI runtime, then communicating with
> all LAMMPS instances whenever the desired fix must be
> computed. The protocol communicates in JSON (JavaScript Object
> Notation) strings and assumes no controller linguistic
> properties beyond a valid MPI implementation.

## Vulnerability and Data Flow Analysis on Arbitrary Languages with Code Property Graphs and Taint Traversals

Summer 2024, paper in-progress

**Jordan Dehmel (CMU)** and Warren MacEvoy (CMU)

Abstract:

> When assessing the security of code, it is paramount to ensure
> that security-privileged routines do not disclose secret
> information to would-be attackers. Similarly, when interacting
> with important and abstract APIs like databases, it must be
> ensured that no unverified user input be allowed direct access
> (EG SQL injection attacks). These problems both involve
> tracking the contributors and dependents of variables at
> debugging time, a common task in analysis and linting. This
> paper examines the use of Code Property Graphs (CPGs)
> [Yamaguchi, Golde, Arp and Rieck, 2014] and taint-style
> vulnerability scanning [Sabelfeld and Myers, 2003] in such a
> context. CPGs are dense and expressive representations of
> program syntax, dependency, and control flow often used in
> linting. Taint-style vulnerability scanning, on the other
> hand, tracks possible vulnerabilities along variable
> modifications and control flow alterations such that sensitive
> data does not flow beyond its desired scope. This paper
> describes a language-agnostic algorithm for the construction
> of CPGs with embedded information-flow security measures and
> details the development of a VSCode extension utilizing them.

## Colloidal Janus Particles Under Applied Electric Fields in Microgravity and comparison to Similar Results via Terrestrial Density Matching (Working Title)

Fall 2024, paper, in journal review
