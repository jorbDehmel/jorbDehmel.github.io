## [The `Oak` Programming Language](https://github.com/jorbDehmel/oak)

`Oak` is a modern, low-level, statically-typed, translated
programming language with extreme macro support, built-in
packaging and building, and compile-time-modifiable language
syntax. `Oak`'s syntax modification makes it a powerful core for
the construction of new programming languages.

## [`libgqlite3`: A `SQLite3`-based GDBM](https://github.com/jorbDehmel/libgqlite3)

A simple, fast GDBM for C++. This is a lightweight, header-only
interface to libsqlite3-dev.

## [`JKnit`: A FOSS Literate Programming CLI Tool](https://github.com/jorbDehmel/jknit)

 A lightweight, FOSS alternative to RStudio/Posit and `.rmd`.
 Can compile `.rmd` files to `.md` or `.tex`, with included
 running code.
