# Notable Projects

All my independent projects are FOSS, usually under the MIT
license. Work associated with publications can be found with
their entries [here](./bibliography.md).

## [`Oak`](https://github.com/jorbDehmel/oak)

The Oak Programming Language. Oak is a modern, low-level,
statically-typed translated programming language with extreme
macro support, built-in packaging and building, and
compile-time-modifiable language syntax. Oak's syntax
modification makes it a powerful core for the construction of
new programming languages.

## [`libgqlite3`](https://github.com/jorbDehmel/libgqlite3)

A simple, fast GDBM for C++. This is a lightweight, header-only
interface to libsqlite3-dev.

## [`JKnit`](https://github.com/jorbDehmel/jknit)

 A lightweight, FOSS alternative to RStudio/Posit and `.rmd`.
 Can compile `.rmd` files to `.md` or `.tex`, with included
 running code.
