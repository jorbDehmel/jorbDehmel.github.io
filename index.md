# Research Interests

*TLDR: Computability, complexity, languages, automata*

Currently interested in formal language systems, particularly
properties of $n$-ary finite-state functions and transduction
systems. Another focus is language theory and computability
problems therein, including static vulnerability analysis,
optimization, static analysis, higher-order macros, etc.
Previously worked in static source code vulnerability analysis
(e.g. the flow of secret information beyond its scope) via taint
traversals and code property graphs.

# Biography

Received a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Colorado Mesa
University, with dual undergraduate research in static source
code analysis and molecular dynamics. Currently a graduate
student of computer science at the University of Colorado
Boulder. Plans to pursue a PhD in theoretical computer science
and a career in research.

Besides research, also experienced in data analysis, software
engineering, and high-performance computing.
