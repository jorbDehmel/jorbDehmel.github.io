# Research Interests

*TLDR: Computability, complexity, languages, automata*

Currently interested in formal language systems, particularly
properties of $n$-ary finite-state functions and transduction
systems. Another focus is language theory and computability
problems therein, including static vulnerability analysis,
optimization, static analysis, higher-order macros, etc.
Previously worked in static source code vulnerability analysis
(e.g. the flow of secret information beyond its scope) via taint
traversals and code property graphs.
